Learn Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA): From Zero to Hero üöÄ
Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) journey! This repository is designed to take you from the basics of DSA all the way to mastering complex algorithms and problem-solving techniques. By the end of this roadmap, you‚Äôll be able to tackle a variety of coding challenges with confidence.

üìö Why Learn DSA?
Mastering DSA is crucial for any developer. It helps you write efficient code, prepares you for technical interviews, and builds the foundation for understanding more advanced concepts in computer science and software engineering.

üî• Learning Objectives
Understand fundamental data structures and their applications
Implement algorithms in JavaScript (or language of choice) and analyze their complexity
Practice problem-solving techniques for interviews and real-world applications
Strengthen your coding and analytical skills
üóÇÔ∏è Roadmap to Success
Introduction to DSA

Importance of DSA
Time and Space Complexity (Big O Notation)
Data Structures

Arrays: Basics, operations, common problems
Linked Lists: Singly and doubly linked lists, common operations
Stacks and Queues: Concepts, applications, and implementations
Hash Tables: Concepts, hashing functions, and applications
Trees: Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, and Tries
Heaps: Min-heap, Max-heap, and priority queues
Graphs: Basics, graph traversals (BFS & DFS), weighted/unweighted
Algorithms

Sorting Algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort
Searching Algorithms: Linear Search, Binary Search
Recursion: Introduction, key problems
Dynamic Programming: Memoization, tabulation, and example problems
Graph Algorithms: Dijkstra‚Äôs, Bellman-Ford, and Floyd-Warshall
Practice Problems

Start with easy-level problems, progressing to medium and hard
Practice on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, CodeSignal
Advanced Topics (Optional)

Advanced data structures (Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees)
Advanced graph algorithms (Minimum Spanning Tree, Disjoint Set Union)
üéØ Approach
Learn by Implementation: Each concept is best understood by coding it out. Start small, understand the logic, and then build up.
Practice Daily: Dedicate at least an hour every day to solve problems.
Focus on Optimization: Work towards improving your solutions for efficiency.
Review and Reflect: Revisit past problems and solutions, identifying areas for improvement.
üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Resources
Language: JavaScript
Platforms: LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, InterviewBit
Community: Join coding groups or forums for support, feedback, and discussion.
üìÜ Consistency is Key
With consistent effort and structured practice, you can achieve mastery in DSA. This journey requires patience and determination. Commit yourself to learning, and the rewards will follow!

Let‚Äôs start your DSA journey from zero to hero!
